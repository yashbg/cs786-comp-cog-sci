    "Once you have complex cells identifying triangles and squares, I want you to simulate the visual search paradigm of Triesman (1980), where the task is to find the odd stimulus in a set of objects. In our case, the objects will be red or blue in color and triangles or squares in shape. Simulating the paradigm means   being   able   to   enter   the   number   of   objects   and   experiment   type (feature/conjunction) as parameters and obtain image frames containing objects with these features as output.

Can   add   timers   and   delays appropriately to simulate neural processing delays. As output, I want graphs of response time versus number of objects in both feature and conjunction search conditions. "
